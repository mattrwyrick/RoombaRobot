# RoombaRobot
This is a Python implementation of a controller for a RoombaRobot. The controller allows the user to connect to a robots blue tooth, control the robot's movement, sounds, and lights, and autonomous driving (following a black line). This was completed in 2014 for the introduction to computer science course csse120 at Rose-Hulman. Group members were Trevor Bednarek, Bill Metcalf, and Matthew Wyrick.
